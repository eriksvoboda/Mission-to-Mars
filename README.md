# Mission to Mars

## Purpose

The purpose of this project is to scrape the images of the four martian hemispheres as well as the featured image and most recent new title and article teaser text from the NASA website. The website seems to have some issues that causes the news to not pull back each time which requires an update in the scraping file for the news to pull back. However it's not each time that the scraping file needs to be updated, and the scraping file works most times. Which makes me belive it's something with the website not the code.
